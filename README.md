# NBA Rookies Career Longevity using Scikit-learn

## Introduction
This project explores the career longevity of NBA rookies using Scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library. Understanding the factors that contribute to the extended careers of NBA rookies is essential for talent scouting, team management, and player development. By creating a predictive model, we aim to provide insights into what makes a rookie's NBA career enduring.

## Problem Statement
The objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts the career longevity of NBA rookies based on attributes such as age, college experience, draft position, and rookie season performance. This project seeks to empower NBA teams and scouts to make informed decisions in selecting and developing rookies.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data was collected from historical NBA rookie statistics, including attributes like points per game, assists, rebounds, and steals. The data was cleaned, missing values were addressed, and feature engineering was performed. Outliers were managed to ensure data quality.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA provided essential insights, including the impact of points per game on career longevity and trends in rookie season performance. Visualizations were used to display the distribution of key statistics, draft positions, and age among rookies. These insights guided feature selection and engineering.

## Feature Selection/Engineering
Feature engineering included creating new variables, such as a performance index based on multiple statistics. Feature selection helped identify the most critical attributes in predicting a rookie's career longevity.

## Model Selection and Training
Various machine learning models, such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, were considered. Following rigorous evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, a Random Forest Regressor was chosen for its superior predictive capability.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance was assessed using regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R^2). The model achieved a low MAE, a small MSE, and a high R^2, indicating its effectiveness in predicting rookie career longevity.

## Results and Discussion
The predictive model successfully estimates the career longevity of NBA rookies, providing valuable insights for talent scouts, team managers, and player development coaches. Recognizing the model's strengths and limitations is vital for its practical application.

## Conclusion
This project underscores the potential of machine learning in the NBA for predicting rookie career longevity. By providing a data-driven approach to talent selection and development, it contributes to the long-term success of NBA franchises and rookies.

## Future Work
Future work may involve expanding the dataset with more historical statistics, including factors like injury history and player leadership qualities. Additionally, developing a user-friendly web tool for career longevity prediction could enhance accessibility for NBA teams and scouts.
